We consider a user-centric network-level coordination architecture for 5G heterogeneous Radio Access Networks (RANs), based on RAN softwarization and a centralized coordination framework. We describe the RAN as a set of logical RAN entities, related to cells in a Heterogeneous Network (HetNet), under the control of a central coordination entity. This description allows the creation of Network Functions (NFs) with an abstracted view of the network. We describe a centralized coordination framework, and then develop a NF for InterCell Interference Coordination (ICIC) in a 5G HetNet, optimizing the radio resource usage at network-level. We construct a Network Graph to abstract the problem of resource allocation and cell offloading, with the NF seeking for an optimal solution based on this abstraction. Simulations are performed in a HetNet scenario with a Tabu Search algorithm. Results show the feasibility of performing network-level coordination through a modular NF, with an abstracted view of the network.
