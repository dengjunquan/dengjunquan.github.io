We consider spectrum sensing in a wideband cognitive radio system where 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are adopted at the radio frequency (RF) sensors. We focus on a practical scenario where multiple narrow-band radio systems coexist in the considered wide spectrum range and the RF sensor has no prior knowledge about those ambient radio systems. First, we use Van Vleckâ€™s arcsine law to analyze the impact of 1-bit sampling on performance of covariance matrix reconstruction. Second, we propose a novel 1-bit wideband spectrum sensing algorithm based on the subspace technique. We show that the proposed method exhibits near-zero false alarm (FA) while achieves the similar probability of detection (PD) performance as compared to conventional FFT based and correlation-based wideband sensing methods [Download paper here](http://dengjunquan.github.io/files/WCSP2019.pdf)
