We consider two-hop Device-to-device (D2D) relaying in multi-cell downlink networks. D2D relaying is envisioned to be a promising cell coverage extension technique, which can provide improved cell-edge performance without a dense infrastructure deployment. Relaying complicates the resource allocation and interference management in multi-cell networks. We first study the aggregate co-channel interference characteristics when D2D relaying is applied. A fluid network model is used to analyze the inter-cell interference in a multi-cell network with a minimum inter-base station distance. We develop a model for capturing the interaction between relaying decisions made in the own cell and inter-cell interference created to other cells. We investigate network steady state, and optimize key parameters for network-level management. Both simulation and analysis results are provided to help to understand the performance of D2D relaying.
