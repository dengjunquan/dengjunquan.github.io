We consider the network-side mobile localization problem in future 5G and beyond wireless networks with distributed multi-antenna base stations (BSs). For this application, we propose a semi-supervised multi-point channel charting (SS-MPCC) framework, which consists of (i) collaborative collection of channel state information (CSI) and other sideinformation by distributed BSs; (ii) local CSI feature extraction and self-learning of a dissimilarity metric, and (iii) global graph construction and constrained manifold learning. We show that side-information from routine network operations, including timestamps, channel qualities, and a small set of labeled samples, can be exploited to construct a consistent global graph. The graph is then mapped to a 2D channel chart using constrained manifold learning for localization purposes. We evaluate the performance of SS-MPCC in a simulated urban outdoor scenario with realistic user motion. Our results show that SS-MPCC achieves a mean localization error of 5.6 m with only 10% of labeled CSI samples. SS-MPCC does not require accurate synchronization among multiple BSs and is promising for future cellular localization.
