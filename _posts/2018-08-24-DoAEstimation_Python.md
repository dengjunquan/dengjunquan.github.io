Here, We consider the Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation using the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique (ESPRIT) algorithms. DoA estimation finds a lot of applications in wireless positioning,
target trackin and MIMI channel estimation etc. MUSIC and ESPRIT are two popular techniques for such problems. ESPRIT is more computationally efficient than MUSIC. The implementation of these two algorithms in Python are presented here. The code is available [here](https://github.com/dengjunquan/DoA-Estimation-MUSIC-ESPRIT).
